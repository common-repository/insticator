= How long does it take for my website to display ad units after adding the widget? =

After you sign up, Insticator will begin its ad unit configuration process. Depending on the site, this process usually can take up to 24 hours. If you do not see ads within 24 hours please reach out to our support team.

Once your ads are showing, revenue will be generated. Please note that every day revenue from the prior day is updated to your dashboard at 5pm EST.

If you have additional questions, please email us at support@insticator.com.

= What is the difference between a pageview and an ad impression? =

In digital advertising, the difference between a pageview and an ad impression is commonly confused.

A pageview counts whenever a web page starts loading onto a visitor’s screen; this triggers a “Page Visit Event” in analytical web tools such as Google Analytics. Pageviews, however, do not necessarily trigger an ad impression since ad impressions are counted whenever an ad unit loads onto a web page.

For more information, read about the difference [here](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/understand-web-traffics-hits-pageviews-impressions-unique/).

= Why is my website not generating revenue, even though my widget is live with ad tags? =

Don’t be alarmed if you don’t immediately see earnings on your dashboard.
Though your website will begin to generate revenue once it’s configured to display ads, there is a standard 24-hour delay before earning metrics are updated in your Insticator account.

Each day, revenue from the prior day is added into your dashboard at 5pm EST.
If you do not see revenue statistics even after 24 hours, please reach out to support@insticator.com. Please note that you can check your earning metrics from your Insticator.com account.

Due to our widget’s responsive and content-saavy design, only one widget can be installed per webpage. However, you can create unlimited widgets via your Insticator account that can be installed on multiple pages throughout your site.
